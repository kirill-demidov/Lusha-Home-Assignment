# Lusha Home Assignment

## Sample data 

In purpose to accomplish Home assignment I'm using postgrsql database. 
To perform a task I've created some sample data - 
[here is the script](https://github.com/kirill-demidov/lusha_Home_assignment/blob/main/create_sample_SQL_data.sql)

## SQL ETL script
All transformations with source data are [here](https://github.com/kirill-demidov/lusha_Home_assignment/blob/main/ETL.sql). 
The final table is called 'fact_purshases' 

## Report mockup 
To create mockup of reports I've used PowerBI - so you can find example of reports in [pdf file](https://github.com/kirill-demidov/lusha_Home_assignment/blob/main/Report%20Mockup.pdf) and I've uploaded the [powerbi file](https://github.com/kirill-demidov/lusha_Home_assignment/blob/main/Lusha_Reports_mockup.pbix) with imported dataset from postgresql
